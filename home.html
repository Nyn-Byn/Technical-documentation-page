          <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
          <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
          <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as head, title, body, header, footer, article, section, p, div, span, img, aside and many others.</p>
          <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the title tag can be written as Title, TITLE, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>
          <p>The articles below can help you learn more about HTML.</p>

        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
        <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p>
        <pre class="brush: plain notranslate">My cat is very grumpy
</pre>

        <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
      
            <h4>HTML</h4>
            
          <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</code>
        <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The opening tag (the first p): This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
          <li>The closing tag (the second p): This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
          <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
          <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>

          <p>In this article, we will know HTML Attributes, and their implementation through examples. All HTML elements have attributes that will provide additional information about that particular element. It takes two parameters, ie, a name & a value which define the properties of the element and are placed inside the element tag.</p>
        <p>Attributes are always added to the start tag of an HTML element. Attributes always come in name/value pairs like this: attribute_name=”value” and attribute values should always be enclosed in quotes
          </p>
        <p>Note: The name parameter takes the name of the property we would like to assign to the element and the value takes the property value or extent of the property names that can be aligned over the element. Every name has some value that must be written within quotes.</p>

          </code>
        <p>Below are some of the most commonly used Attributes in HTML.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>src</li>
          <li>alt</li>
          <li>height and width</li>

            <p>The <code>&lt;p&gt</code> tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything mentioned within <code>&lt;p&gt</code> and it is treated as a paragraph. A paragraph is a block-level element so a new paragraph always begins on a new line, and browsers naturally put some space before and after a paragraph to make it look neat and easy to read.</p>
            <h3 id="syntax">
          Syntax:
            </h3>
          <code><span>&lt;p&gt; Content &lt;/p&gt;</code>
          </pre>
        <p>Properties of the paragraph tag:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As already mentioned, the<code>&lt;p&gt</code>tag automatically adds space before and after any paragraph, which is basically margins added by the browser.</li>
          <li>If a user adds multiple spaces, the browser reduces them to a single space.</li>
          <li>If a user adds multiple lines, the browser reduces them to a single line.</li>
          <li>By default, the display of the Paragraph element is set to “block” which you can change using CSS. This means that if you add another paragraph to the webpage the next paragraph will be inserted in the next line on the webpage.</li>

            <p>The web browser displays the alphabets, numbers and some other symbols correctly. This is all possible because of the required character set that web browser uses. The character set or character encoding has different character encoding standards which assign some numbers to these character set which can be used in the internet.</p>
            <p><strong>ASCII:</strong> American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ANSII) created this character encoding. This character encoding are used in C/C++ programming. It has 128 alphanumeric characters consisting of alphabets(A-Z) and (a-z) and some special symbols like + – * / ( ) @ etc.</p>
      <p>ANSI(Windows-1252): American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created character encoding supported 256 characters. It is used as default character set in Microsoft Windows.</p>
      <p>ISO-8859-1: It is used as default character set of HTML4 and also supports 256 characters. The International Standards Organization (ISO) defines the standard character sets for different alphabets/languages. It contains numbers, upper and lowercase English letters, and some special characters.</p>
      <p>UTF-8: UTF-8 and UTF-16 standards was developed by Unicode Consortium, because the ISO-8859 character-sets are limited, and not compatible a multilingual environment. It consists all the character and punctuation symbols.</p>
      <p>Attribute: Web browser must know the character encoding standard used in the html page and this we do as given below.</p>
